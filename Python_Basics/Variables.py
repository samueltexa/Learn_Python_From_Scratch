"""What is a variable in Python
When you develop a program, you need to manage values, a lot of them. To store values, you use variables.
In Python, a variable is a label that you can assign a value to it. And a variable is always associated with
a value.
Creating variable
variable_name = value
coout = 1 """
message = 'Hello, World!'
print(message)
# message a varible that stores "Hello, World"
message = 'Good Bye!'
print(message)

# In conclusion
#     A variable is a label that you can assign a value to it. The value of a variable can change
#     throughout the program. Use the variable_name = value to create a variable.
#     The variable names should be as concise and descriptive as possible. Also, they
#     should adhere to Python variable naming rules.
